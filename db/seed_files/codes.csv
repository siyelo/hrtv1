the dissemination of strategic information, on best practice programme effciency and effectiveness, planning/evaluation of prevention, care, and treatment efforts; analysis and quality assurance of demographic and health data related to HIV, and the testing of implementation models even though these may be conducted in a delivery institution. Also included are coordination activities, for instance in support of the 'Three Ones' principles: Coordination of a 
single approved AIDS action framework and support to build/strengthen one National AIDS Coordinating Authority. Also included are expenditures related to the conduct of national AIDS strategic planning and of human resource planning (e.g. district level). The resource tracking for human resources under programme costs is different to the disbursements of human resources as reported for personnel providing prevention and treatment-ASC.01 and ASC.02-because they are offered as part of health care delivery services (e.g. salary of a doctor dedicated to PMTCT, which would be a component of PMTCT and should be accounted as a production factor of the ASC related to PMTCT)."

1) guide the planning, coordination, and implementation of the HIV response; 2) assesses the effectiveness of the HIV response; and 3) identify areas for programme improvement. In addition, M&E data are required to ensure accountability to those affected by HIV, in addition to those providing fnancial resources for the HIV response.

 M&E therefore includes expenses related to ascertaining the direction and ultimate achievement of measurement of programme progress, the 
provision of feedback for accountability and quality, and implementation of targeted programmatic evaluation, the implementation and upgrading of information management systems (e.g. other monitoring and health management information systems), the evaluation of prevention, 
care, and treatment efforts. Expenditures on M&E should include the salaries of the staff who implement M&E programmes. "

Also included are sentinel studies, mandatory reporting of cases, and epidemiological analysis. Surveillance implies ongoing and systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of data on a disease or health condition. 
Collecting blood samples for the purpose of surveillance is called serosurveillance. Built upon a country's existing data collection system, second-generation HIV surveillance systems are designed to be adapted and modifed to meet the specifc needs of differing epidemics. For example, HIV surveillance in a country with a predominantly heterosexual epidemic will differ radically from 
surveillance in a country where HIV infection is mostly found among MSM or IDUs. Surveillance for drug resistance is to be recorded under the below category . The surveillance programmes aim to improve the quality and diversity of information sources by developing and implementing standard and rigorous study protocols, using appropriate methods and tools."
,,1050204,10502,4.06 HIV drug-resistance surveillance,Planning and M&E,Across all 3 objectives,Health Promotion,,nasa,HIV Drug-Resistance Surveillance,,,"HIV drug-resistance surveillance includes the setting up of sentinel sites, laboratory operations, materials and goods, and the integration and support for the activities of a National HIV-Drug Resistance Committee. HIV drug resistance surveillance is aimed at the epidemiological monitoring of the prevalence and to determine the circulation of resistant viral strains among specifc HIV-positive populations. This provides the number or proportion of HIV positive people in a given population whose HIV is resistant to particular anti-HIV drugs. 
The genotypic antiretroviral resistance test (GART) determines whether a particular strain of HIV has specifc genetic mutations associated with drug resistance. The test analyses a sample of the virus from an individual's blood to identify any genetic mutations associated with resistance 
to specifc drugs. The phenotypic assay is different from a genotypic assay; it uses an indirect method, and determines by a direct experiment whether a particular strain of HIV is resistant to anti-HIV drugs."

These expenditures aim to increase the capacity of logistics and drug supply systems, including staffng, development of administrative systems, and upgrading of transportation infrastructure. 
These activities involve support systems for pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, medical equipment, medical commodities, and supplies to provide care and treatment of people living with HIV and related infections. This includes the design, development, and implementation of improved systems for forecasting, procurement, storage, distribution, and performance monitoring of HIV pharmaceuticals, and of relevant commodities and supplies. This includes actual spending to improve ordering, procurement, shipment, and delivery of the full range of HIV-related pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, and other medical commodities.
